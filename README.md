Design Choices

Theme and Aesthetics

For my hobby website, I chose a Sanrio theme to reflect my love for collecting Sanrio characters and merchandise. Sanrio is famous for its adorable characters like Hello Kitty, My Melody, and Cinnamoroll. I opted for a color palette dominated by pastel colors, pinks, and whites to capture the playful and cheerful spirit of Sanrio.

I selected the 'Press Start 2P' font, which has a pixelated, retro video game feel. This choice complements the nostalgic and whimsical nature of Sanrio characters, enhancing the thematic consistency and providing a visually engaging experience.

Layout and Structure

The website is structured into several pages: Home, About, and Contact. This layout ensures that content is organized and easy to navigate. 

Home Page: Introduces my collection with images and a video embed, setting the tone for the entire website and welcoming visitors.
About Page: Details the origin of my collection and showcases my favorite characters, adding a personal touch and sharing my story and preferences.
Contact Page: Includes a form for visitors to get in touch, encouraging interaction and feedback.
Interactivity

To enhance engagement, I incorporated JavaScript functionalities. The interactive image gallery allows users to click on thumbnails for larger views, making the website more dynamic and user-friendly.

The navigation bar features dropdown menus styled with CSS, providing a clean and organized way to access different sections. CSS transitions create hover effects on buttons and navigation links, enhancing visual appeal and interactivity.

Reflection on Implementation

Challenges and Solutions

During implementation, maintaining thematic consistency and ensuring user-friendly navigation were primary challenges. Integrating a Sanrio theme required careful selection of colors, fonts, and images. I addressed this by choosing specific fonts and color palettes characteristic of Sanrio, ensuring a cohesive design.

Implementing functional dropdown navigation was another hurdle. It required meticulous CSS styling and testing to ensure smooth functionality across different devices. I used relative positioning and hover effects to ensure the dropdown menus were accessible and displayed correctly.

Thought Process

The design process began with a deep dive into Sanrio's brand identity and my personal interests. Every design choice, from color palettes to font selection, was influenced by Sanrio's charm. My goal was to create a website that not only showcases my collection but also embodies the whimsy of Sanrio characters.

I prioritized user experience by designing a clear, structured website with easy navigation. Interactive elements like the image gallery and dropdown menus were added to make the website engaging and dynamic.

Final Thoughts

Creating my Sanrio hobby website was a fulfilling experience that combined thematic design with functional web development. The final result is a vibrant, user-friendly website that effectively showcases my Sanrio collection. Through thoughtful design choices and careful implementation, I achieved a visually appealing and highly functional website that captures the joy and charm of Sanrio.
